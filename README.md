Kava is a lightweight [Page Object Model](http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/06_test_design_considerations.jsp#page-object-design-pattern) framework that sits on top of XCTest for scalable UI testing. The framework encourages separation of concerns by removing test code from services and utility methods and prevents duplication of code by defining behaviors within reusable "Blocks".
